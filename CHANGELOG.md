### 0.2.1+1

* Moved Vane's code to a [public Github repo](https://github.com/DartVoid/Vane) 
  and updated README with link to Github repo.

### 0.2.1

* Added some simple middleware classes. One that logs all request to the 
  console (press "console" in dashboard of DartVoid to see it) and one that 
  enables cross origin requests to your handler. If you enable the Cross 
  middleware during development you can for example run the client code locally 
  and have the server code run on DartVoid (we did this during the development
  of DartVoid's dashboard, it is written with Vane and has been developed on 
  the platform it self...). 

### 0.2.0

* Added "the tube", a new way to communicate between middleware handlers. See 
  docs for examples.

### 0.1.0+1

* Syntax fix in docs.

### 0.1.0

* Initial release.
